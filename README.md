# autoapproval

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dkhmelenko/autoapproval.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dkhmelenko/autoapproval)

A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) for approving pull requests automatically

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4306809/50573484-13a0a100-0dd5-11e9-8ef3-aad5069e83e3.png)

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run typescript
npm run build

# Run the bot
npm start
```

This app requires `Write code` permissions in order not to have issues with approving PRs.
```
Repository administrators can require that all pull requests receive a specific number of approving reviews from people with write or admin permissions in the repository or from a designated code owner before they're merged into a protected branch.

...

You won't be able to merge your pull request until the required number of reviewers with write or admin permissions in the repository approve your pull request's changes in their review.
```

More about it can be found on [Github Help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-reviews#required-reviews).

## Configuration

In order to use the bot, the config file should be provided. Config file should be defined in your repository. Config file is the yml file with the path `.github/autoapproval.yml`. The file should have 3 entries.

### from_owner
Defines the list of users, whos pull requests should be approved automatically. For example:
```
from_owner:
  - dkhmelenko
  - quongeri
```
Assign an empty array if you want to approve PRs from any user (example: `from_owner: []`).

### required_labels
Defines the list of labels on PR, which should be present for approving PR automatically. For example:
```
required_labels:
  - ready
```
Assign an empty array if you want to approve PRs without any label (example: `required_labels: []`).

### blacklisted_labels
Defines the list of labels on PR, which will prevent the PR from being automatically approved. For example:
```
blacklisted_labels:
  - wip
```
Assign an empty array if you do not want to blacklist any labels.

### apply_labels
Defines the list of labels on PR, which should be added once PR was approved automatically. For example:
```
apply_labels:
  - merge
```
Assign an empty array if no labels should be applied to PRs (example: `apply_labels: []`).

_NOTES_: 
1. If label doesn't exist, it will not be created. In order to apply the label after approving PR automatically, you need to define the label beforehand.
2. If PR already contains all labels from **apply_labels** config, it will not be approved assuming that it was already approved.
